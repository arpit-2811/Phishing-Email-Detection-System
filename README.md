# Phishing-Email-Detection-System
This is a Simple Phising email detection system website where  you can simple copy the emails and paste to the website and predit the email use the code of frontend directly and can add the server.js file and you can run the frontend. 
I have used HTML CSS and javascrypt for frontend and node.js express for backend of the login and signup you can use mysql and mongodb both for the database.
sorry for the datasets can't upload it because of the file size you can find your own datasets from kagel or other platform 
now after finding datasets you load the csv file on the train.py file and run it 
and you can change the file locations according to you in the code 
Now run the app.py file and your models is trained now you can use the project
